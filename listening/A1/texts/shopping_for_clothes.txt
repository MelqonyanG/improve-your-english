Hello, can I help you?

I'm just looking, thanks.

Excuse me?

Yes?

Where are the changing rooms?

They're over there. Behind you.

Thank you.

Hi. Excuse me again. Do you have this jumper in black?

Yes, just a moment. What size do you need?

Extra small, please.

Here you are.

How much is this?

It's Â£29.

Can I pay by credit card?

Yes, you can. Of course.

Would you like a bag for that?

Yes, please.
