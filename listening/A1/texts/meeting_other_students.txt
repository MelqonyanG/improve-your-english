So, now you've got the important information, it's time to meet each other. Everyone turn to the people next to you and introduce yourselves.

So, hi. I'm Cara. And you are?

Robert.

Selim.

Nice to meet you!

Robert and You too.

Nice accent. Where are you from?

I'm from Glasgow.

Oh, really? My mum's from near Glasgow, so I'm half Scottish.

Cool. Do you live in Scotland?

No, we live in England, near Manchester. My dad's from there. What about you, Selim?

I'm from Leeds originally but I grew up near London.

Are you both doing history on its own?

No. I'm doing history and German.

I'm doing it with maths, actually.

History and maths. That's different!

Yeah, I couldn't decide between arts and sciences. Maths doesn't help with remembering dates, though! And you?

I'm doing history and French.

I wanted to do French but German was easier, so I took that.

German is so hard!
