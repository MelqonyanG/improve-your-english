Hello, this is the sales department. Jane Solomon speaking.
Hello, is Maria Fernandez there, please?
No, I'm sorry. She's not in the office at the moment. She's on her lunch break.
Oh. Could you take a message, please? Could you tell her that Peter Griffin called?
Sure. Could you give me your number?
It's 0-7-4-6-0 double 9-0-1 double 8.
Thanks. That's 0-7-4-6-0 2-9-0-1-2-8.
Sorry, no. It's 0-7-4-6-0 9-9-0-1-8-8.

Yes. Please ask her to call me back, and tell her it's about the PXO project. I need the new project figures.
The PXO project. Right. I'll give her your message when she comes back to the office.
Thank you. In case I'm in a meeting when she calls back, can I give you my email address too?
Of course.
