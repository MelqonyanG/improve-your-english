Jani: Welcome to the department, Yuki. Let me show you around and tell you about your new colleagues. I'll introduce you to them all later.
Yuki: Great. Thanks. So, who are those people over there?
Jani: That's the order management team. Luciana deals with the new orders. She's the one with short, dark hair.
Yuki: In the purple dress?
Jani: Yeah, that's right. You'll probably work closely with her while you are learning about our ordering process.
Yuki: Got it, thanks. And who's that over there? The guy who's on the phone?
Jani: Oh, you mean the one by the window? In the green shirt? Ah, that's Ian. He's the marketing director. And that's Maria beside him. She's responsible for the internal IT systems.
Yuki: OK, I'll try to remember all of this. I should probably be taking notes!
Jani: Don't worry about it. For now it's just good to put some faces to names.
Yuki: OK, great – and who do I talk to about setting up my mobile phone with email access? Is that also Maria?
Jani: No, you need to talk to Sebastian who works in communications. He can help you. That's him over there, next to the printer.  
Yuki: Thanks. I'll introduce myself to him later.
