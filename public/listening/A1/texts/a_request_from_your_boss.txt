Hi, Mario. Can you help me prepare some things for the next month?

OK, sure. What can I help you with?

I need to visit the customer in Germany. It's important.

What can I do to help?

Can you send an email to the customer? Ask them when I can visit them next week. Please do this first. It's a priority and very urgent.

Right. I'll do it today.

Thanks. This next task is also important. Can you invite everyone to the next team meeting?

Yes, I will.

But first you need to book a meeting room. After that, please send everyone an email about it.

Yes, of course.

And finally, can you write a short report about our new project? I have to give a presentation to our managers next month. Please do it when you have time â€“ sometime in the next two or three weeks. It's not too urgent.

Sure, no problem. I can do it this week.

There's no hurry. Take your time.
