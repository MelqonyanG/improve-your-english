Hello, Gino's.

Hi. Can I book a table for tomorrow night, please?

How many people is it for?

Four.

And what time would you like?

About eight, eight thirty maybe?

Let's see ... We're pretty busy tomorrow, so I can do half past seven or nine.

Oh. OK, then. Half seven, please.

What name is it?

Jamie.

J-A- ...?

M-I-E

OK, so that's a table for four at half past seven tomorrow evening.

Great. Thanks! Bye.

Bye.

Hello, Gino's.

Hi, I called earlier to book a table for four and I was wondering if I can make it for six instead?

Ah, what name was it?

It's Jamie.

Table for four at half past seven. So you want to change it to 6 o'clock?

No, sorry. Can I make it for six people?

Oh, I see. Sorry! That shouldn't be a problem. I can move you to a bigger table but it will be nearer the kitchen. Is that OK?

No problem. Is it possible to change the time as well? Make it a little bit later?

Ah ... yeah, we can. Is eight OK for you?

Perfect, thanks!

Lovely. See you tomorrow, then.

Thanks! Bye!

Thanks. Ciao!
