Hi, my name's Peter. What's your name?

Hi, Peter. I'm Carla. I'm new here.

Welcome to the company, Carla.

Thanks, Peter. I'm happy to be here and it's nice to meet you.

It's nice to meet you too.

Where do you work?

I work in the design team. We sit over there.  

I'm in the marketing team. I started last week.

You work in marketing? That's very interesting.

Yes, it is. I'm enjoying it. But there are a lot of new things to learn.

I'm sure there are. I'm happy to help you if I can.

Thank you, Peter. What do you do in the design department?

I design new products.  

That sounds interesting. I plan marketing events for new products. So I think we'll work together sometimes.

That would be great. So, where are you from, Carla?

Brazil. And you?

I'm from the UK.

How long have you been here?

I've worked here for three years but I actually moved here from the UK five years ago, to study.
