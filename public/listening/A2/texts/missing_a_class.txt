Student: Excuse me, Ms Henderson?
Teacher: Yes, Diana. How can I help you?
Student: I'm sorry, but I can't come to class next Wednesday. I have a doctor's appointment.
Teacher: OK. Thanks for letting me know.
Student: Is there anything to do at home?
Teacher: Let me just check my notebook. OK, first of all … you need to read chapters 17, 19 and 20 in the book. There are also some articles and a video to watch – those are online. I'll post the links online in the usual place.
Student: Chapters 17 to 20.
Teacher: Yes, except chapter 18. Chapters 17, 19 and 20.
Student: Ah, OK. Um ... is there a deadline?
Teacher: Yes, this Friday. But there's something else. I was going to give you all a practice test.
Student: A practice test?
Teacher: Yes, to help people prepare for the mid-term exam.
Student: Ah. All right.
Teacher: Don't worry, I can send you the practice test by email on Wednesday. Can you send it to me before Friday?
Student: Sure, no problem.
Teacher: And don't forget to bring a certificate from the doctor to the office.
Student: Thanks, Ms Henderson! I'll do that.
Teacher: You're welcome, Diana. Take care.
