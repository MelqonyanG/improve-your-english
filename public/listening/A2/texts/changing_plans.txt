Francesco: Sachi? Sachi? Sachiko! 
Sachi: Francesco! Is everything OK?
Francesco: Yes. Yes. Sorry, I saw you and I was across the street … I ran.
Sachi: I see. What's up?
Francesco: Do you have the tickets … for the play?
Sachi: No, I don't. I'm going to buy them this afternoon.
Francesco: Oh good, good. Listen, don't buy tickets for this Friday.
Sachi: Oh? Why not?
Francesco: I can't go to the theatre on Friday. Something's come up. I have a concert this Friday.
Sachi: Another concert? But you said …
Francesco: I know, I know. I'm sorry. I forgot.
Sachi: Francesco! 
Francesco: How about next week? Are you free then? I can definitely go next Friday.
Sachi: Francesco. You did this two weeks ago, remember? I had cinema tickets for the new Marvel movie and you changed the plans then too. For band practice.
Francesco: I know, and I …
Sachi: We also missed my favourite dance group. Because your band was playing at some child's birthday party.
Francesco: It was my nephew's birthday …
Ha! 
Francesco: OK, why don't we go out for dinner before my concert? Then, next Friday we can go to the play.
Sachi: Oh …
Francesco: Come on, Sachi. Just this one more time.
Sachi: OK, but promise me next Friday. OK?
Francesco: I promise. I promise!
