Hi, Anna. Do you have a minute to talk about the meeting next Tuesday?
Sure. We said 11, didn't we?
Yeah, we did. But I have a bit of a problem with the time. Would it be possible to move it?
Oh, I see. We could postpone it to the afternoon, to 1 p.m., for example. Or bring it forward to earlier in the morning. What would suit you?
Could we make it 9 o'clock? That would really help me. I have another important meeting in the central office at 12.
No problem. It's important you're there.
Thanks a lot, Anna.
Do you need help with any preparation? Did you get the agenda I sent out?
Yes, I did. And no, that's all fine, thanks. My report is ready and I'm looking forward to presenting it.
Great.
I can tell Sven about the time change. I'll see him later.
Don't worry about telling Sven. I'll send an email to everyone to confirm the time has changed and with an updated meeting invite.
Great. Thanks, Anna.
OK. I'm happy that works for you. We really need you there and it's good we don't have to cancel it.
See you then. Have a good weekend in the meantime.
You too.
